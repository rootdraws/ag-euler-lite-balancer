## 🎯 Project Overview

**Euler Lite** is a lightweight multi-chain DeFi application that provides lending and borrowing services through the Euler Finance protocol. It supports multiple EVM chains and connects via standard EVM wallets. The application allows users to:

- **Lend Assets**: Deposit crypto assets to earn yield
- **Borrow Assets**: Use collateral to borrow other assets
- **Swap Collateral & Debt**: Swap between collateral or debt assets via integrated DEX routing
- **Swap-and-Supply/Borrow**: Deposit or borrow with automatic cross-asset swaps
- **Repay from Savings**: Repay debt using savings positions (same or cross-asset)
- **Explore Markets**: Discover and compare markets grouped by curator/product
- **Manage Portfolio**: Track positions, rewards, and performance
- **Access Rewards**: Participate in Merkl and Brevis reward programs

## 🏛️ Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: Nuxt.js 3, Vue 3, TypeScript
- **Blockchain**: Multiple EVM chains
- **DeFi Protocol**: Euler Finance
- **Wallet Integration**: Wagmi / Reown (EVM wallets)
- **Styling**: SCSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: Vue Composition API with composables
- **Linting**: ESLint (flat config) with pre-commit hooks (simple-git-hooks + lint-staged)
- **Testing**: Playwright (E2E)
